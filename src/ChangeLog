	timezone-completion: use libsoup for geoname lookups
	
	Gio wasn't made for handling a lot of quick http api requests. It spawns
	another process and keeps "mounts" of those requests around indefinitely (see
	GNOME bug #509609).
	
	Just use libsoup directly.
	
	(Also fix some memory leaks and keeping the connection open by failing to unref
	the input stream.)

2015-05-07  Lars Uebernickel  <lars.uebernickel@canonical.com>

	timezone-completion: don't use g_cancellable_reset()
	
	There might still be oustanding async operations for the same cancellable, for
	which g_cancellable_is_cancelled() should continue returning FALSE.
	
	Create a new cancellable for new operations instead. This is recommended by the
	documentation for GCancellable.

	Merge lp:~dshea/timezonemap/location-cycle

2015-03-24  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Cycle through a smaller list of map locations on repeated clicks.
	
	Cycling through the entire map causes erratic jumps between locations,
	especially if starting in a sparsely populated area. Limit the candidate
	locations to those within 50px of the mouse click, or the nearest
	location if no location is within 50px.

2015-03-24  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Fix a memory leak and potential crash with the locations list
	
	Store the head of the locations list separately so that the references
	to list elements are not lost as the list is iterated over. If the end
	of the list of reached, restart at the beginning.

	Update the latest data, regenerate map, add docs

2015-05-01  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Removed timezone_-5.5.
	
	There is no UTC-5:30 zone, and the file itself is a misnamed copy of
	timezone_-9.5.png.

2015-05-01  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Import the latest data from geonames.org.

2015-05-01  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Regenerated the map background and overlays

2015-05-01  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Added some instructions for how to generate new PNGs
	
	I'm not sure if this is the best way to do this, but it's reproducible.
	Also added a description of the other data files in src/data.

2015-05-01  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Cleaned and updated the time zones SVG.
	
	The SVG map had some issues, and had not been updated in at least a
	decade.
	
	Removed layers:
	- s0, which appears to be a scratch layer
	- edit, same
	- tz_export, which looks incomplete and should really be generated
	from the other layers
	- tz_color_codes, ditto
	- bg, since it doesn't contain anything and it was messing up the page
	size
	
	Also removed an extra Iceland that was in layer m1 for some reason.
	
	Added new layers for half and quarter hour zones, except -04:30 which
	was already there.
	
	Retraced portions of the map using the August 2013 time zone map from
	the CIA World Factbook, which is in the public domain.  Also made some
	additional changes not included in the CIA map. The larger changes
	include:
	
	- Updated time zones in Brazil for changes made in 2008 and 2012
	- Updated the Russian time zones, mostly visible on the eastern end
	- Moved Sri Lanka from +06:00 to +05:30, changed in 2006
	- Moved Chile from -04:00 to -03:00 after their change to year-round
	DST in 2015.

2015-03-24  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Remove the color codes map.
	
	cc.png is used to map locations on a map (usually mouse clicks) to time zone
	offsets. However, in every case except one, the offset set by get_loc_for_xy()
	is immediately overwritten by set_location(). For the exception case
	(cc_timezone_map_get_timezone_at_coords), having the selected_offset property
	change during the call is an unexpected side effect.
	
	Furthermore, the data in the color_codes array was not entirely in sync with
	the data in cc.png (e.g., no color_codes entry for UTC+14), and the borders
	between zones in cc.png are feathered instead of being zones of a single pixel
	value, so clicks around the borders would result in no zone being selected. If
	cc.png is ever revived, it needs to be regenerated from the SVG source.

2013-11-14  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Moved CcTimezoneLocation into its own file.
	
	Mixing GObject and non-GObject code in tz.c confuses g-ir-scanner and
	adds a lot non-introspectable identifiers to the .gir file.
	
	Added get and set functions for the CcTimezoneLocation properties.

2013-11-14  David Shea  <dshea@redhat.com>

	Create local copies of string properties.
	
	The string values passed to set_property are owned by the caller, so we
	need to create new copies of the strings to store in the private data
	structure.
	
	The dispose method already had code to free the private strings, but was
	missing a check for the en_name property: added one.

libtimezonemap data files
=========================

A brief explanation of the files in this directory and how to generate the
ones that are generated:

admin1Codes.txt, cities15000.txt, countryInfo.txt
  These three files come from the geonames.org database. Simply find the files
  in http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/ and copy them to this directory.

olsen_map.png
  This is a map of the tzdata timezones, with each zone encoded as a RGBA
  value. The data source is probably the shapefiles provided at
  http://efele.net/maps/tz/world/, but the origin and how to update it is
  otherwise something of a mystery.

pin.png
  The location pin. Nothing fancy.

time_zones_countryInfo-orig.svg
  The master SVG used to generate the map images. It is lovingly hand-updated,
  mostly by using inkscape to trace over whatever map image is convenient.

bg.png
  The background of the map, based on the master SVG with some color changes.
  It can be generated with the following steps:

  * Open time_zones_countryInfo-orig.svg in inkscape
  * Right click over an ocean area, choose "Select This"
  * Edit -> Select Same -> Fill and Stroke
  * Edit -> Copy
  * Create a new, blank document with File -> New
  * In the blank document, Edit -> Paste In Place
  * Open the Fill and Stroke dialog with Object -> Fill and Stroke
  * Under the Fill tab, change the RGBA value to 95a9c8ff
  * Go back to the original SVG. Right click a land area, "Select This"
  * Edit -> Select Same -> Fill and Stroke
  * Edit -> Copy
  * Switch to the new document, Edit -> Paste In Place
  * In Fill and Stroke, under the Fill tab, change RGBA to ffffffff
  * Edit -> Deselect
  * File -> Document Properties...
  * Under the "Custom Size" heading, expand "Resize page to content"
  * Click "Resize page to drawing or selection"
  * File -> Export PNG Image...
  * Choose "Page" as the Export area, and set the image size to 800x410
  * Set the filename to bg.png under "Export As..."
  * Click Export

timezone_*.png
  These are the overlay images displayed for a timezone selection. Each one is
  generated from a layer in time_zones_countryInfo-orig.svg. To generate new
  images:

  * Open time_zones_countryInfo-orig.svg in inkscape
  * Open the layers dialog with Layer -> Layers...
  * For each layer:

    - Right click the layer, choose "Show/hide other layers"
    - File -> Export PNG Image...
    - Choose "Page" as the export area and 800x410 as the image size
    - Set the filename in Export As...  For example, m3 becomes
      timezone\_-3.png, and p9-5 becomes timezone_9.5.png. m0 becomes
      timezone_0.png
    - Click "Export"
